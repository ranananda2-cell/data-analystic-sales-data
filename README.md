# Detailed Description of the Project
In this project, 
I analyzed a sales dataset to evaluate profit margins across different products, categories, and over time. The key steps involved:
•	Data Exploration: I started by examining the dataset's structure, data types, and basic statistics to understand the scope and quality of the data.
•	Profit Margin Calculation: I computed the profit margin for each transaction by dividing profit by sales, then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage. This helped identify how profitable each sale was relative to its revenue.
•	Trend Analysis Over Time: I converted order dates into datetime objects and grouped data monthly to observe how profit margins fluctuated over time. I visualized this trend with a line chart, revealing seasonal patterns and periods of higher or lower profitability.
•	Insights: The analysis uncovered specific months with higher profit margins, indicating seasonal or promotional effects, and periods with lower margins, possibly due to increased costs or lower sales.
